With the increase in demand for higher datarates at a very low latency increases to supportnumerous different use cases as we move towards data-driven and data-intensive world, the need to investigate ways to improve the existing communication infrastructure is cruicial. In this work, we have tried to analyse two different domains of active research as of today namely - Re-configurable Intelligent Surfaces and Multi-AP Coordination in WiFi. With the emergence of Smart Radio Environments (SREs), the ability to control the signal propagation is very helpful to utilise and virtually mould the environment to our use. Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces can be used to assist exsiting communication systems to improve the SNR for cell edge users. Our work provides a new way to incorporate RIS panels in traditional communication system and analyse the behavior of received SNR versus system parameters. We also present insights that there will exist regions where the relative benefit per RIS deployed is better than other regions, which could be exploited in RIS allocation. The second problem this work tries to analyse is to serve users using coordinated transmission such that the user gets the same signal in a constructive manner from multiple transmitters. This is an active research in the Wi-Fi 7 standardisation process. We present results that suggests the concept is beneficial in Wi-Fi networks. Further we present a scheduling scheme named fluid model for different modes of service, explaining the queue evolution, stability and conditions for stationary queue.
